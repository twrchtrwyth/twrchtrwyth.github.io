## Hotel

[Book-a-Bed Poshtel](https://www.booking.com/hotel/th/book-a-bed-poshtel.en-gb.html) looks a good option.

### SHA Extra Plus

What a bloody mess this is! 

In order to comply with requirements, the first night of our stay will need to be in a designated *SHA Extra Plus* hotel---that is, one that meets certain standards set by Thailand's *Safety and Health Administration* regarding rates of staff vaccination, and which has a contract with a hospital partner who provide testing services and treatment if required.

There seems to be no standardised use of the correct logo or term. The SHA have a logo which includes the word "Extra" on their homepage. The *SHA Extra Plus* filter on the SHA's own website returns hotels with a logo stating `Plus+`, despite the *SHA Plus* filter returning a bunch of hotels with the exact same logo! Only a single hotel has actually included the word "Extra" in the logo. What a bizarre way to go about things.
