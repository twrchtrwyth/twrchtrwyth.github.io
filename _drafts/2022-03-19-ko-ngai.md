## Saturday 19th March

Still fresh from Flavio's near-death experience, we arrived on Ko Ngai's eastern beach by longtail in the pouring rain. We had a massaman curry served to us on the beach by the boatmen, then hurried to our accommodation at *Kaimuk Thong* through the downpour.

We checked in, then went to the bar for tea, coffee, and beer. We maintained this state of existence for the rest of the day. For dinner I had a pad thai, and Ellen had something with very al dente chicken that we can't really remember much about. On the advice of Not-Grandma, we resolved to get up at 06:00 the next morning to see the sun rise over the limestone karsts to the east
