## Tuesday March 15th

arrived in ban saladan
got a tuktuk to new coconut bungalows in khlong khong
hibiscus juice?
met zha who was very impressed with my passport photo. didn't say anything about Ellen's (but did later comment that her face looked nice without a mask)
beachfront raised decking, view out west over the sea. rocks visible as tide went out
had green curry stir fry, Ellen had yellow noodle, also leo
went for a walk along the beach, found a shady spot and had a snooze but had to flee from the 1.5cm ants who presumably lived there and were unhappy with our intrusion
lots of hermit crabs shuffling along the beach
Ellen got a fresh coconut at Coco Bar, I had a coconut smoothie (similar but with ice and the pulp added)
we then wandered back down the beach and marvelled at the numerous crab burrows surrounded by beautiful patterns, like circular mazes whose walls were composed of tiny balls of sand each a few millimetres in diameter. having looked this up, I think these must have been sand bubbler crab burrows: the tiny balls of sand are deposited after they have filtered organic matter from it using their mouthparts. these are destroyed when the tide comes in, but the crab survives within its burrow inside a bubble of air.
we stopped at *another* freedom bar, this time heavily reggae themed (the seemingly obligatory bob marley soundtrack was present and correct), where we had a beer and watched the sun set. the staff carried out what looked like Molotov cocktails, set them in a pile of sand and then lit them. lanterns which looked like buoys with holes drilled in them. supposedly the bar is usually a hotspot for nightlife, but you wouldn't have known it: few people there and very quiet.

## Wednesday March 16th

little of interest to write about today, but was great. pretty much just chilled on the decking near our bungalow and read and played cards. Ellen gave me a swimming lesson.
