* Negative PCR within 72 hours preceding arrival
* Negative PCR on D1 (&D5? Subject to change, from 1st March may not be required, LFT instead)
  - In Phuket should be possible to do this at the airport from the 1st of March
  - They will also provide LFT free-of-charge
* Proof that designated quarantine hotel ("SHA Extra Plus" status) booked for D1 (& D5? Subject to change as above)
* Proof that transport from airport to quarantine hotel has been booked

## Hotel

[Book-a-Bed Poshtel](https://www.booking.com/hotel/th/book-a-bed-poshtel.en-gb.html) looks a good option.

### SHA Extra Plus

What a bloody mess this is! There seems to be no standardised use of the correct logo or term. The *SHA Extra Plus* filter on the SHA's own website returns hotels with a logo stating `Plus+`, despite the *SHA Plus* filter returning a bunch of hotels with the exact same logo! Only a single hotel has actually included the word "Extra" in the logo. What a bizarre way to go about things.
