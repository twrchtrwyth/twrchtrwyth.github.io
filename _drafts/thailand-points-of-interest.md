## South Central Plains

This is the region just north of Bangkok. Reachable by car, bus or rail.

### Ayutthaya

Former capital until sacked by Burmese forces in 1767, at which point the capital was moved downstream to Thon Buri---now a district of Bangkok west of the river---before finally moving to what is now Bangkok's Old City (formerly known as Rattanakosin) to the east of the river in 1782. Popular tourist destination.

### Lop Buri

One of Thailand's oldest cities (dates to c. 6th century). Supposedly little-known to tourists. Was a Khmer outpost from c. 11th century. Superseded by the city of Sukhothai in the central plains---this was the capital of the first notable kingdom of the Tai people---and then by the city and state of Ayutthaya, to which the province of Lop Buri was linked through marriage.

### Pra Phutthabat

Pilgrimage site for Buddhists, where a "footprint of Buddha" was discovered in the early 17th century. A temple now stands on the site. Close to Lop Buri (to the southeast).
