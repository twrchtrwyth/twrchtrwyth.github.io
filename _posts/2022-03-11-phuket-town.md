Written at Uphill Cottage on Ko Phi Phi.

## Thursday 10th March

With an almost indescribable sense of relief to be out of quarantine (and to escape the karaoke at the market directly outside our window), we set out to Phuket's Old Town. The architecture there is wonderful, supposedly a product of Portuguese colonial influence on the Chinese merchants who settled here in the 19th century.

We were both hungry, and very much looking forward to to trying the local food. We found *Kopitiam by Wilai*, a delightful little restaurant on the central street of Phuket Old Town. There were scrolls of Chinese calligraphy on the wall, along with some old photographs of Phuket. The menu carried several Phuket-style dishes, which displayed a Chinese culinary influence as far as I could tell.

Ellen had Massaman chicken with jasmine rice, and pad pal meang (local greens stir fried with egg) as a side. Singha to drink. I had Phuket Style Grilled Pork (pork with Thai and Chinese herbs), with chicken wonton as a side. Chang to drink. It was all glorious.

We realised after eating that we didn't have enough cash with us to pay, so I went searching for an ATM (leaving Ellen as collateral). I found two, but failed dismally at getting cash out at both. I tried asking at a 7-Eleven, but I think the cashier thought I was trying to hand her my card (or worse) and she just gestured towards the door. I obligingly exited. It was worth it for this amusing advert, though:

We then realised we could just pay by card anyway. Back to the hostel for an early night, as we were both still pretty shattered from the trip.

## Friday 11th March

After a very long sleep indeed, we headed out at around 11am for breakfast. We went to Campus Coffee Roasters, a western-style coffee house/cafe just off the central street of the Old Town. We both had some very sweet almond pastries. I had a cold brew coffee:

And Ellen had some distressingly blue tea (a mix of black tea,  peppermint and "butterfly pea"):

We went on a more successful hunt for some cash after my disastrous attempts the night before. We *tried* to find somewhere else, but being creatures of habit, we returned to *Kopitiam by Wilai* for lunch. I had a Phuket-style noodle soup with pork and seafood, and a *delicious* passion fruit iced tea. Ellen had a pad Thai. We also shared some kaya toast---sweet milk bread with very sweet coconut jam.

We then returned to the hostel for a cold beer. The hostel had a book titled *Siamese Bestiary*: I read a section on King Cobras, and for some reason have particularly remembered the section on their especially savage bite. Supposedly they don't bite and withdraw like other snakes: rather, they chew the wound in order to continue injecting further venom. I was delighted to learn that they are endemic to the whole of South East Asia.

We decided on an approximate route for our planned "island hopping", starting with Ko Phi Phi Don tomorrow. We are then planning on heading to Ko Lanta or Ko Jum, then Ko Hai, Ko Muk and Ko Kradan, before finally heading down to Ko Lipe and Ko Tarutao. The boat for Ko Phi Phi leaves at 9am, and we have to be ready for pick-up from the hostel by 7:30. We are both sad about this fact.

Once we'd booked this, Ellen went in the pool, and I sat next to it reading some more *Gilgamesh* (the beast-man does indeed spend a full week with a prostitute) whilst drinking another Singha.

Despite the casual tone struck above, the whole experience was in fact fraught with danger as we were under threat from a tropical Sword of Damocles:

That evening, we went for a final walk around the old town---noticed how grand the building was from where we'd got cash earlier in the day, which we completely overlooked at the time---before grabbing yet another Singha at the Old Phuket Coffee House.

We had food in One Chun---Ellen had Phuket pork stew (black peppery and delicious), I had phuket-style fried fish in soy sauce. We shared stir fried morning glory, and both had steamed rice. On the way back to the hostel we heard a very amusing cover of Britney Spears's *Toxic*, and we got some passion fruit ice lollies from the local convenience store. Wary of going to bed before the night market outside our window closed at 10:30pm lest we be exposed to more karaoke whilst trying to sleep, we instead had a beer at the market and turned in not long after... But not before popping down to the convenience store again to buy some antigen testing kits, as nobody could tell us whether or not one will be supplied to us on Day 5 (despite the *Test & Go* scheme stating that one is provided free of charge). The joys of modern travel.
