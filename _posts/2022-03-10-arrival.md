## Phuket Airport

We have arrived! After some amazingly efficient processing by the airport---it took 40 minutes from landing to getting in to our taxi to the hostel, from where I am writing this---and *another* PCR test, we are now well on our way to Phuket Town. The buildings lining the road are typically mismatched in size, design and colour, and are in various stages of dereliction: we passed the eerily beautiful concrete husk of a mosque, like an ossified flower bud.

Bit of an upgrade from the A4 route from Bristol Airport into Bath, at least.

## Hotel

We have now arrived at the hotel. Room is great, plenty of space and a mezzanine bed. Have to quarantine until we know the results of our PCR tests from this morning. We are both flagging---neither of us slept very well on the flight. We are watching some Thai TV in an attempt to stay awake, but I don't think it's working as Ellen has nodded off already. (I then fell asleep in the middle of writing something... Looked like "oh no"?!)

### PCR Results

It's now 6pm. The lady at the hotel desk just knocked on our door to tell us that both our PCRs are negative for SARS-CoV-2! We are officially allowed out to see Thailand!
