**Warning: boring and overly technical detail ahead.**

I started this blog in February 2022, to document our travels after finishing work earlier in the month. My initial aim was to write posts on a ThinkPad X60s using the *Jekyll* framework, then push any changes to GitHub whenever I found an internet connection. Instead of carting around upwards of a kilo of computing equipment---and battling with the foibles of a 15 year old laptop---I have decided to use the same approach with my phone (a 1st-generation iPhone SE) On my phone, I'm using an app called *Working Copy* to push changes to GitHub. Then, thanks to *GitHub Pages*, a website will be automagically generated from the files. I've never done this before, so many things will undoubtedly go wrong. I'm also stuck with the fairly boring initial theme until I figure out how to customise it!

I've decided on this approach primarily so that, if I lose my phone, then everything I've written will remain safely stored online. It might also circumvent some of the problems with firewalls that MÃ¡ire and Roger said they experienced when using Wordpress in Vietnam, should we make it that far.

As far as adding photographs goes, I'm planning on using a film camera (an Olympus OM-1n) when I travel, so these will be added later once the rolls are developed. I'll try to leave placeholders to remind myself.
