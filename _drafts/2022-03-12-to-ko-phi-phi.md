## Saturday 11th March

up at 06:45 for 07:30 transport to quay---ferry at 09:00
minibus was late
us and and 7 others in minibus
got to harbour--no ticketing system, just waved unofficial-looking bit of paper from hostel at the person on the way in to the terminal and were given a little red *Ko Phi Phi* sticker.
had an iced latte in the terminal, Ellen had a lemon tea which was essentially concentrated lemon juice with a tea bag dipped in it.
loads of people were having a big party on the front of the boat: not a single one of them could do the Macarena. I was very concerned for the well-being of a balding man's pate.
before docking at Ton Sai on Ko Phi Phi Don (the larger of the two islands), the ferry first did a loop of Ko Phi Phi Leh. It was very pretty, amazing limestone cliffs.
sooo much cooler on the island (still roasting but manageable in shade)
insane damage prices: get ready to pay £12.50 if you break a clothes hanger, or £50 for the kettle!
