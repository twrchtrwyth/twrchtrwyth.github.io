I started this blog to document our travels after finishing work in February 2022. My aim is to write posts on a ThinkPad X60s from 2006 using the *Jekyll* framework, then push these to GitHub whenever I find an internet connection. This will then (hopefully) generate a website from the files.

I've decided on this approach--that is, using a cheap, old but hardy laptop and hosting the blog on GitHub--primarily so that, if the laptop is lost, stolen or damaged irreperably, then everything I've written will still be safely stored online.

I'm not sure what I'm going to do in terms of adding photographs: I'm planning on using a film camera when I travel, so might just have to add in the photos later once the rolls are developed.
