## Edinburgh to Helsinki

Finally, 21 months after we were originally due to fly to Bangkok, the first leg of the journey is underway! Writing this in the air: currently flying over the beautiful snowy plateaus of Norway, complimentary blueberry juice (thanks Finnair!) in hand. I have started reading the Epic of Gilgamesh (or *He Who Saw The Deep*)---or rather, I almost have, as I'm still ploughing through the introduction. It's genuinely longer than the Epic itself. Perhaps the author should have carved it in cuneiform on clay tablets: might have encouraged a bit more brevity.

Apparently someone decided to replace the tap in the aircraft toilet with a water cannon, so it will be a soggy hour or so until we land in Helsinki. We will have a roughly 5-hour layover there: once we arrive, in the time-honoured fashion of self-experimentation, I am planning on determining whether there is an LD50 of cardamom. (Assuming the cinnamon doesn't kill me first.)

## Helsinki to Phuket

We have arrived at Helsinki airport! Concerningly, the first thing we noticed was that the Finnair flight to Bangkok has apparently been cancelled. Phuket looks like it's still running, though... So fingers crossed we're fine.

Actually, all flights to Bangkok over the past week (at least: we didn't look any further back) have been cancelled. Ellen pointed out that Bangkok is not part of either the *Test & Go* or *Sandbox* schemes, so actually it's unlikely anyone is flying there, which hopefully explains today's cancellation.

More importantly, the little convenience stores in the airport still stock korvapuusti, and they are as delicious as ever. We briefly considered heading in to the centre of Helsinki, but it is currently at the daily high temperature of a whole degree centigrade, and everything is covered in a blanket of snow.
